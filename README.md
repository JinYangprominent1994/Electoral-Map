## The Description

The year chart allows you to visualize different election years where you can select a specific year to explore.

The electoral vote chart visualizes the winning party and the number of electoral votes corresponding to each state.

The vote percentage chart displays the percentage of votes won by each party and independent candidates in some cases.

The tile chart visualizes the same data as the electoral vote chart but provides geospatial context. In addition, this will also display the distribution of votes within a state.

The brush can list the selected states in the appropriate div and highlight the selected states on the tile chart
